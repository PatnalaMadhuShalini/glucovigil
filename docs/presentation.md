### Core Algorithms

**Risk Assessment Algorithm:**
```typescript
function calculateDiabetesRisk(healthData: HealthData): Prediction {
  let riskScore = 0;
  // Age factor
  if (healthData.demographics.age > 45) {
    riskScore += 2;
  }
  // BMI calculation
  const bmi = calculateBMI(healthData.physiological);
  if (bmi >= 30) {
    riskScore += 3;
  }
  // Additional factors...
  return normalizeScore(riskScore);
}
```

**Recommendation Generation:**
- Risk factor analysis
- Prioritization algorithm
- Personalization engine
