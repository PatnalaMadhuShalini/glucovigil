#### 4.4.1 Diabetes Risk Assessment Algorithm

The core risk assessment algorithm calculates a diabetes risk score through a weighted analysis of multiple health factors:

```typescript
function calculateDiabetesRisk(healthData: HealthData): Prediction {
  let riskScore = 0;
  const riskFactors: string[] = [];
  
  // Demographic risk analysis
  if (healthData.demographics.age > 45) {
    riskScore += 2;
    riskFactors.push("Age over 45 - increases risk of type 2 diabetes");
  }
  
  // Physiological risk analysis
  const bmi = calculateBMI(healthData.physiological.height, healthData.physiological.weight);
  if (bmi >= 30) {
    riskScore += 3;
    riskFactors.push("BMI over 30 (obese) - high impact on insulin resistance");
  } else if (bmi >= 25) {
    riskScore += 2;
    riskFactors.push("BMI 25-30 (overweight) - moderate impact on insulin resistance");
  }
  
  // Blood sugar analysis
  if (healthData.physiological.bloodSugar > 140) {
    riskScore += 3;
    riskFactors.push("Elevated blood sugar - potential pre-diabetic condition");
  } else if (healthData.physiological.bloodSugar > 100) {
    riskScore += 1;
    riskFactors.push("Blood sugar at upper range of normal - monitor closely");
  }
  
  // Blood pressure analysis
  if (healthData.physiological.bloodPressure.systolic > 140 || 
      healthData.physiological.bloodPressure.diastolic > 90) {
    riskScore += 2;
    riskFactors.push("Hypertension - associated with increased diabetes risk");
  }
  
  // Mental health factors
  if (healthData.mentalHealth?.stressLevel === "severe" || 
      healthData.mentalHealth?.stressLevel === "high") {
    riskScore += 2;
    riskFactors.push("Severe stress level - high impact on blood sugar control");
  }
  
  if (healthData.mentalHealth?.sleepQuality === "poor") {
    riskScore += 1;
    riskFactors.push("Poor sleep quality - affects glucose metabolism");
  }
  
  // Lifestyle factors
  if (healthData.lifestyle.exercise === "none") {
    riskScore += 2;
    riskFactors.push("Sedentary lifestyle - major risk factor for insulin resistance");
  }
  
  if (healthData.lifestyle.diet === "poor") {
    riskScore += 2;
    riskFactors.push("Poor diet quality - impacts blood sugar regulation");
  }
  
  // Family history
  if (healthData.familyHistory?.diabetesInFamily) {
    riskScore += 2;
    riskFactors.push("Family history of diabetes - genetic predisposition");
  }
  
  // Substance use
  if (["heavy", "binge", "dependent"].includes(healthData.lifestyle.smoking)) {
    riskScore += 1;
    riskFactors.push("Heavy smoking - increases insulin resistance");
  }
  
  if (["heavy", "binge", "dependent"].includes(healthData.lifestyle.alcohol)) {
    riskScore += 1;
    riskFactors.push("Heavy alcohol consumption - affects pancreatic function");
  }
  
  // Normalize score to 0-5 scale
  const maxPossibleScore = 21;
  const normalizedScore = Math.min(5, (riskScore / maxPossibleScore) * 5);
  
  // Determine risk level
  const level: "low" | "moderate" | "high" =
    normalizedScore <= 2 ? "low" :
    normalizedScore <= 3.5 ? "moderate" : "high";
  
  // Generate recommendations
  const recommendations = generateRecommendations(normalizedScore, healthData, riskFactors);
  
  return {
    score: parseFloat(normalizedScore.toFixed(1)),
    level,
    recommendations,
    riskFactors
  };
}
```

#### A.4.2 Recommendation Generation Algorithm

The recommendation algorithm creates personalized health suggestions based on identified risk factors:

```typescript
function generateRecommendations(
  riskScore: number,
  healthData: HealthData,
  riskFactors: string[]
): string[] {
  const recommendations: string[] = [];
  
  // Add specific recommendations based on identified risk factors
  riskFactors.forEach(factor => {
    if (factor.includes("Severe stress level")) {
      recommendations.push(
        "Consider stress management techniques like meditation or deep breathing exercises",
        "Establish a regular sleep schedule to improve stress resilience"
      );
    } else if (factor.includes("Poor sleep quality")) {
      recommendations.push(
        "Aim for 7-8 hours of quality sleep each night",
        "Create a calm bedtime routine without screens 1 hour before sleep"
      );
    } else if (factor.includes("Sedentary lifestyle")) {
      recommendations.push(
        "Start with 10-minute walks after meals and gradually increase activity",
        "Find physical activities you enjoy to make exercise sustainable"
      );
    } else if (factor.includes("Poor diet quality")) {
      recommendations.push(
        "Increase vegetable intake to at least 3 servings per day",
        "Reduce processed food and added sugar consumption"
      );
    }
    // Additional factor-specific recommendations...
  });
  
  // Add general recommendations based on overall risk score
  if (riskScore > 3.5) {
    recommendations.push(
      "Schedule a comprehensive health assessment with your healthcare provider",
      "Monitor your blood sugar levels regularly"
    );
  } else if (riskScore > 2) {
    recommendations.push(
      "Consider discussing diabetes prevention strategies with your healthcare provider",
      "Implement healthy lifestyle changes to reduce your risk factors"
    );
  } else {
    recommendations.push(
      "Maintain your current healthy habits",
      "Continue regular health check-ups"
    );
  }
  
  // Personalize recommendations based on user data
  if (healthData.physiological.weight > 0 && healthData.physiological.height > 0) {
    const bmi = calculateBMI(healthData.physiological.height, healthData.physiological.weight);
    if (bmi > 25) {
      const idealWeight = calculateIdealWeight(healthData.physiological.height);
      recommendations.push(
        `Consider a gradual weight loss goal of ${Math.round(healthData.physiological.weight - idealWeight)} kg`
      );
    }
  }
  
  return [...new Set(recommendations)]; // Remove duplicates
}
```

## 3. SYSTEM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

### 3.1 OBJECT ORIENTED ANALYSIS AND DESIGN

Object-Oriented Analysis and Design (OOAD) provides the foundation for GlucoSmart's architecture, ensuring a modular, maintainable, and scalable system.

#### 3.1.1 Scenarios

The GlucoSmart Health Analytics platform addresses the following key user scenarios:

**Scenario 1: Initial User Registration and Risk Assessment**
A 45-year-old individual with a family history of diabetes discovers the GlucoSmart platform while researching diabetes prevention. They register an account, providing basic demographic information (age, gender, ethnicity) and preliminary health data (height, weight, recent blood glucose reading). The system creates a user profile, securely stores the health data, and runs an initial risk assessment algorithm. Based on the limited information, GlucoSmart calculates a preliminary risk score and categorizes the user as "moderate risk," highlighting age and family history as key risk factors. The system generates initial recommendations for further health data collection to refine the assessment.

**Scenario 2: Comprehensive Health Profile Completion**
Following the initial assessment, the user returns to complete a comprehensive health profile. They input detailed physiological measurements (blood pressure, hemoglobin A1C, additional glucose readings), lifestyle information (exercise frequency, diet quality, smoking status, alcohol consumption), and mental health data (stress levels, sleep patterns). The HealthDataService validates the new information, stores it securely in the user's profile, and the RiskAssessmentService recalculates a more precise risk score based on the complete dataset. The system identifies additional risk factors, including elevated BMI and high stress levels, and adjusts the risk category.

**Scenario 3: Personalized Recommendation Generation**
After the comprehensive assessment, the RecommendationService analyzes the specific risk factors identified and generates a prioritized list of personalized health interventions. For this user, recommendations focus on gradual weight reduction through specific dietary changes (reducing processed carbohydrates), a beginning walking regimen, and stress management techniques suited to their work schedule. Each recommendation includes rationale linking it to the specific risk factors identified and practical implementation steps. The user reviews each recommendation and selects several to implement.

**Scenario 4: Medical Document Integration**
The user has recently received laboratory results from their annual physical examination. They upload the PDF document to GlucoSmart using the document upload feature. The DocumentProcessingService extracts relevant health metrics from the report, including fasting glucose levels, cholesterol readings, and blood pressure measurements. The system presents the extracted data for the user's verification, and upon confirmation, integrates it into their health profile. The risk assessment is automatically updated with the clinical measurements, providing a more accurate evaluation.

**Scenario 5: Progress Tracking and Longitudinal Analysis**
Three months after implementing selected recommendations, the user returns to input updated health metrics, including weight, blood pressure, and a new glucose reading. The system compares the new values against baseline measurements, calculating the percentage improvements and visualizing trends. The RiskAssessmentService recalculates the diabetes risk score, which has decreased from 3.8 to 3.3, moving from "high" toward "moderate" risk. The system generates positive reinforcement messages highlighting the improvements and adapts recommendations based on the progress made and changing risk profile.

**Scenario 6: Health Report Generation**
Prior to a scheduled doctor's appointment, the user generates a comprehensive health report from GlucoSmart. The ReportGenerationService compiles a professional document that includes risk assessment results, identified risk factors, key health metrics with trend analysis, and a summary of implemented lifestyle changes. The PDF report uses clear visualizations and plain language explanations suitable for sharing with healthcare providers. This facilitates a more informed discussion about diabetes prevention strategies during the medical appointment.

**Scenario 7: Educational Content Interaction**
While reviewing their mental health risk factors, the user notices that stress is significantly contributing to their diabetes risk. They navigate to the related educational content, where the system presents evidence-based information about the stress-diabetes connection, explaining how stress hormones affect insulin sensitivity and blood glucose regulation. The content includes practical stress management techniques specifically beneficial for diabetes prevention. The user completes a brief knowledge assessment to reinforce their understanding and bookmarks relevant content for future reference.

**Scenario 8: Mobile Health Tracking Integration**
The user connects their fitness wearable device to GlucoSmart using the integration feature. The system begins receiving regular data feeds of step counts, heart rate, sleep duration, and exercise sessions. This automated data collection enriches the user's health profile with objective measurements without requiring manual entry. The RiskAssessmentService incorporates this continuous data stream into a more dynamic risk model, providing more frequent updates and correlational analyses between activity patterns and glucose regulation.

Each scenario represents a distinct user journey within the GlucoSmart platform, highlighting how the object-oriented architecture responds appropriately to different user needs and contexts, providing a personalized, comprehensive approach to diabetes risk management.

The GlucoSmart system is built around a comprehensive domain model that represents the key entities and relationships:

**User Domain:**
- The `User` class represents registered system users with attributes including username, password (hashed), fullName, email, phone, gender, place, and verification status.
- User entities maintain relationships with health data, feedback, and achievements.

**Health Data Domain:**
- The `HealthData` class serves as the central entity for storing user health information.
- It contains nested object structures for different aspects of health:
  - `Demographics`: Age, gender, and ethnicity information
  - `Physiological`: Physical measurements including height, weight, blood pressure, blood sugar, A1C, GTT, and hemoglobin
  - `Lifestyle`: Exercise habits, diet quality, work style, alcohol and smoking behaviors
  - `MentalHealth`: Stress levels, mood patterns, sleep quality, and anxiety levels
  - `FamilyHistory`: Diabetes prevalence in family and other hereditary conditions
  - `FinancialStatus`: Insurance coverage and healthcare accessibility factors

**Assessment Domain:**
- The `Prediction` component encapsulates risk assessment results, including numerical score, risk level categorization, and generated recommendations.
- `NutritionPlan` and `ExercisePlan` classes provide structured intervention strategies based on user health data.
- The `Achievement` system gamifies health improvement through recognizing user progress.

#### 3.1.2 Service Layer Design

- **Service Layer Pattern**: Encapsulates business logic in dedicated service classes that operate on domain entities
- **Factory Pattern**: Creates complex objects like health assessment reports and recommendation plans
- **Strategy Pattern**: Allows for interchangeable risk assessment algorithms depending on available data
- **Observer Pattern**: Enables notification of health status changes to interested components
- **Decorator Pattern**: Enhances base functionality with additional features like data validation and transformation

#### 3.1.4 Object-Oriented Principles Application

The GlucoSmart system embodies core OO principles:

- **Encapsulation**: Each class encapsulates its data and behavior, exposing only necessary interfaces
- **Inheritance**: Specialized classes extend base functionality (e.g., different types of health recommendations)
- **Polymorphism**: Common interfaces allow for substitutable components, particularly in the risk assessment engine
- **Abstraction**: Complex operations are abstracted behind simple interfaces, hiding implementation details

#### 3.1.5 Type System and Schema Validation

GlucoSmart leverages TypeScript's strong typing system and Zod schema validation to ensure:

- Compile-time type checking
- Runtime data validation 
- Self-documenting code through explicit type definitions
- Consistent data structures throughout the application

This comprehensive OO approach results in a robust, maintainable system architecture that can evolve to accommodate new features and changing requirements while maintaining code quality and system integrity.
