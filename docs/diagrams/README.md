This directory contains UML and other diagrams for the GlucoSmart Health Analytics platform. These diagrams are written in Mermaid.js notation, which is a simple markdown-like script language for generating diagrams.

## How to Use These Diagrams

1. View the diagrams directly in GitHub or any Markdown viewer that supports Mermaid.js
2. For quick access to all diagrams, see the [index.md](index.md) file
3. To modify these diagrams, edit the Mermaid code in each file

## Diagram Purpose

These diagrams provide a comprehensive visualization of the system architecture, workflows, and data structure for the GlucoSmart Health Analytics platform. They serve as essential documentation for developers, architects, and other stakeholders to understand the system design.

Each diagram focuses on a different aspect of the system:
- Structural diagrams (Class, Object, Component) show how the system is organized
- Behavioral diagrams (Activity, Sequence, State) show how the system operates
- Relational diagrams (ER Diagram) show how data is structured and related
- Physical diagrams (Deployment) show how the system is deployed

## Tools Used

These diagrams were created using Mermaid.js notation, which allows for version-controlled, text-based diagrams that can be rendered in various environments.
