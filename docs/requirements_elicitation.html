        <h3>1. Introduction to Requirements Elicitation</h3>
        <p>
            The requirements elicitation process for GlucoVigile Health Analytics involved a comprehensive 
            approach to gather, analyze, and document the needs of potential users, healthcare providers, 
            and other stakeholders. This document outlines the methods used, findings, and resulting requirements 
            that form the foundation of the system design.

        <h3>3. Analysis of Existing Systems</h3>
        
        <h4>3.1 Current State Assessment</h4>
        <p>
            Current diabetes risk assessment systems typically exhibit the following characteristics:
        </p>
        
        <div class="requirement">
            <strong>Finding 1:</strong> Paper-based questionnaires remain the predominant method for diabetes risk screening in clinical settings, with limited digital integration.
        </div>
        
        <div class="requirement">
            <strong>Finding 2:</strong> Existing digital tools primarily focus on physiological metrics (BMI, blood pressure, glucose levels) with insufficient consideration of lifestyle and mental health factors.
        </div>
        
        <div class="requirement">
            <strong>Finding 3:</strong> Most systems provide one-time risk assessments without capabilities for longitudinal tracking or adaptive recommendations.
        </div>
        
        <div class="requirement">
            <strong>Finding 4:</strong> User interfaces of existing tools often employ medical terminology without adequate explanation, creating barriers for users with limited health literacy.
        </div>
        
        <div class="requirement">
            <strong>Finding 5:</strong> Integration with external health data sources (EHRs, wearables) is minimal or non-existent in most consumer-facing applications.

        <h3>8. Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
            The requirements elicitation and analysis process for GlucoVigile Health Analytics has identified a 
            comprehensive set of user needs and system requirements. The findings highlight the importance of 
            creating a personalized, accessible, and actionable platform for diabetes risk assessment that 
            overcomes the limitations of existing approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            Key insights from this process include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>The critical importance of integrating physical, mental, and lifestyle factors for comprehensive risk assessment</li>
            <li>The need for clear, jargon-free explanations of health concepts to improve user understanding</li>
            <li>The value of longitudinal tracking and adaptive recommendations based on user progress</li>
