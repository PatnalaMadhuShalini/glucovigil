The use case diagram illustrates the key interactions between users and the GlucoVigile system. The diagram shows three main actors:

End User - The primary system user who registers, inputs health data, tracks progress, and accesses recommendations
Healthcare Provider - Medical professionals who review shared reports and patient data
System Administrator - Technical personnel who maintain and monitor the system
The diagram captures core use cases including:

User Management: Registration and profile management
Health Data Management: Input of health metrics and medical record uploads
Risk Assessment: Generation of risk scores and personalized recommendations
Progress Tracking: Monitoring health improvements over time
Reporting: Creating and sharing health reports with providers
System Administration: User management, performance monitoring, and algorithm updates
The diagram also shows include/extend relationships between use cases, highlighting how certain functionalities are linked, with recommendations being included in the risk assessment process.

Primary Actors:

End User: The primary actor who uses the application to assess and manage their diabetes risk. They represent individuals concerned about their health who seek personalized insights and recommendations.

Healthcare Provider: Medical professionals who interact with the system primarily to review patient health reports generated by the platform. They may use these reports during consultations to provide more informed healthcare decisions.

System Administrator: Technical personnel responsible for maintaining the platform, monitoring system performance, and analyzing aggregate user data to improve the system.

Key Use Case Categories:

User Management

Register Account: End users create new accounts with basic information
Manage Profile: Users update their profile information, including demographics, preferences, and privacy settings
Authenticate: Users securely log in to access their personalized dashboard
Health Data Management

Input Health Data: Users enter physiological measurements (weight, blood pressure, glucose levels), lifestyle factors (exercise, diet), and mental health information
Upload Medical Records: Users upload medical documents from which the system extracts relevant health metrics
View Historical Data: Users access their past health metrics and risk assessments
Track Trends: The system provides visualizations of changes in health metrics over time
Risk Assessment and Recommendations

Calculate Risk Score: The system processes user health data through evidence-based algorithms to determine diabetes risk level
Generate Recommendations: Based on identified risk factors, the system creates personalized, prioritized health recommendations
Adjust Goals: Users set and modify health goals based on recommendations
Monitor Progress: The system tracks progress toward risk reduction goals
Reports and Education

Generate Health Report: Users create comprehensive health reports summarizing risk assessment and progress
Share with Provider: Users can share reports with healthcare providers
Access Educational Content: Users view contextual educational material about diabetes risk factors and management
Complete Knowledge Assessments: Users test their understanding of diabetes prevention concepts
System Management

Monitor Performance: Administrators track system metrics and ensure optimal operation
Analyze User Statistics: Administrators review anonymized usage patterns to improve the platform
Manage Content: Administrators update educational materials and recommendation algorithms
Ensure Compliance: Administrators verify the system meets regulatory requirements
Key Relationships:

Include Relationships: Some use cases automatically include others (e.g., inputting health data includes calculating a new risk score)
Extend Relationships: Optional extensions to base use cases (e.g., report generation can extend to sharing with providers)
Generalization: Common patterns shared across multiple use cases (e.g., data validation across different input types)
The use case diagram illustrates the comprehensive nature of the GlucoVigile platform, showing how it serves different stakeholder needs while maintaining a focus on the end user's health management journey. The clear separation of user management, health data operations, risk assessment, educational components, and system administration demonstrates the well-structured approach to addressing the complexities of diabetes risk assessment and prevention.
