Evaluates physiological metrics (BMI, blood sugar, blood pressure)
Assesses mental health factors
Considers lifestyle factors
Weighs family history
Produces normalized risk score (0-5 scale)
Recommendation Generation Algorithm:
Analyzes identified risk factors
Generates personalized health suggestions
Prioritizes recommendations by impact
Removes duplicate suggestions
Adapts based on user characteristics
Document Processing Algorithm:
Extracts health data from medical records
Uses pattern recognition for metrics
Validates extracted values
Integrates data with health profile
Risk Trend Analysis Algorithm:
Tracks changes in risk factors
Calculates improvement percentages
Identifies significant trends
Projects future trajectory
Generates progress visualizations
These algorithms work together to provide comprehensive health analytics and personalized recommendations for diabetes risk management.

Based on the codebase analysis, here are the currently implemented algorithms in GlucoVigil:

Machine Learning (ML) Algorithms:

Risk Assessment Algorithm

Evidence-based weighting system for risk factors
Feature importance scoring based on clinical guidelines
Normalized risk score calculation (0-5 scale)
Pattern Recognition Algorithm

Medical document text extraction
Health metric pattern matching
Regular expression based data extraction
Note: The current implementation primarily uses rule-based algorithms and statistical methods rather than complex ML/DL models. The system uses evidence-based clinical guidelines (like ADA and CDC statistics) to calculate risk scores and generate recommendations. There are no deep learning algorithms currently implemented in the codebase.

The main algorithmic logic can be found in the risk assessment and recommendation generation functions in server/routes.ts, which use deterministic rules based on medical guidelines rather than trained ML models.
